        <h1>Favorite Thing From This Summer</h1>
        <h2>Attended a bachelorette party in Las Vegas</h2>
        <p>I have never been to Vegas before in my life and for some reason I thought instead of easing my way into it I should go all out and attend my cousins 4 day long bachelortte party with each day packed <b FULL> </b> of activities. </p>

        <h2>What I learned from this trip</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Never plan a trip with 20 people in Vegas</li>
            <li> Apply sunscreen to the part in you hair</li>
            <li> Do not wear brand new shoes to Vegas beacuse you will have blisters for days and walk on the Vegas strip barefoot everywear becasue of the pain <i>(not my brightest moment)</i></li>
            <li> Drinks are INSANELY expensive and I am not proud of my $75 Vodka Redbull <i>(it did however come in a cool cup)</i>...still not justified </li>
    </ol>
